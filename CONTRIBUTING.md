# PIC-SURE CONTRIBUTION GUIDE

## Code of Conduct

When you contribute to a PIC-SURE project, you agree to abide by our ![Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-hpds/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Code Contributions 

### Code and Repo Practices

To get started contributing, you can follow the installation instructions for the PIC-SURE all-in-one application here:
https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-all-in-one/blob/master/README.md 

### Pull Request Submission

In general, we follow the !["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)
1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

Anyone can submit a pull request for PIC-SURE applications. Each pull request should include a unit test for any new code, as well as pass any available Github Action tests on the relevant repo before it can be submitted to the PIC-SURE development team. If you believe there to be an issue with the Github tests, you can raise a bug report issue with the details so we know to take a look.

We ask that if submitting changes for multiple repositories for one connected issue, that you make sure the tests pass for all repos before submitting to avoid confusion.

Additionally, each request from a contributor outside of the core PIC-SURE team should follow this format for requests:


- Enhancement made or issue fixed in the project: 
- Description of changes made to the project: 
- Unit test implemented/performed: 
- (Optional) Links to related issue(s), if any:
- (Optional) Links to related pull requests in other repositories, if any: 
- (Optional) Organization the developer belongs to: 
- (Optional) PicSure team member communicated with regarding this issue, if any:  


Once notified of a new request, we will be in contact within 5 business days to let you know the status of your request.


## Other Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the PIC-SURE application. Our primary source of communication aside from pull requests is through the "Issues" tab of GitHub. Once we have received an issue submission, we will be in contact within 5 business days. 

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, first take a look through any other submitted issues to see if anyone has reported the same bug yet. If so, feel free to comment to let us know that it is also impacting you so we know to elevate the issue, as well as to add any additional details you may have. 
If no other issue has been raised, you should select "New Issue". The title should be a short summary of the bug, and the comment should add any relevant details, such as the steps taken to reach the problem, the browser version and operating system you are using, screenshots, errors, or code if applicable(providing that there is no sensitive information). Finally, please add the "bug" label to the issue. For example:

### Suggesting enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement to the application, first take a look through any other submitted issues to see if anyone has suggested the same or a similar improvement. If so, feel free to comment to let us know that you would also like that feature so we can try to gauge interest.
If no one else has suggested the improvement, you should select "New Issue". The title should be a short summary of the requested feature or improvement, and the comment should add any relevant details such as use cases or similar features in other applications for reference. You should also add the "enhancement" label to the issue before submitting.
For example:
